# Hi, I'm Berk 👋

I’m a Türkiye based **gameplay systems–focused software developer** who enjoys building interactive mechanics, simulations, and tools that sit at the intersection of **games, algorithms, and real-time systems**.

My main background is in **game development**, especially movement mechanics, procedural systems, and simulation-driven gameplay, but I also build **Python tools**, **web projects**, and **backend systems** when the problem calls for it.

## 🔧 What I Work On

- 🎮 **Gameplay & Systems Development**  
  Movement mechanics, procedural generation, agent-based systems, and game logic.

- 🧠 **Simulations & Algorithms**  
  Emergent behavior, crowd dynamics, and rule-driven systems using Python.

- 🛠️ **Tooling & Automation**  
  Small but practical tools to support development workflows.

- 🌐 **Web & Backend**  
  JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and backend logic for production-minded projects.
